                        <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so.
                            Today, examples of machine learning are all around us. Digital assistants search the web and play music in response to our voice commands. Websites recommend products and movies and songs based on what we bought, watched, or listened to before. Robots vacuum our floors while we do . . . something better with our time. Spam detectors stop unwanted emails from reaching our inboxes. Medical image analysis systems help doctors spot tumors they might have missed. And the first self-driving cars are hitting the road.

                        <p>“Machine Learning is the new SQL for Big Data “

This quote illustrates that machine learning will be a major bifurcation in 2018.

Machine Learning is no longer just a niche subfield of computer science but technology giants have been using it for years – Machine learning algorithms power Walmart product recommendations, surge pricing at Uber, fraud detection at top financial institutions, content that Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram display on social media feeds or Google Maps. Machine learning products are being used daily, perhaps without realizing it. The future of machine learning is already here, it’s just that machine learning career is exploding now because of smart algorithms being used everywhere from email to mobile apps to marketing campaigns. If you are in search of the most in-demand and most-exciting career domains, gearing up yourself with machine learning skills is a good move now.</p>
